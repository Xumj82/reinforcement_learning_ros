# reinforcement_learning_ros
Hi guys! This repo is an python implementation for reinforcement learning with ROS noetic and Gazebo 11. In case , the debug and enviroment configuration is quite painful for many beginners of ROS with Gazebo, this repo provide some examples to isolate the ROS environment and pytorch environment. The robot example is based on my [simple air hockey game project](https://github.com/Xumj82/air_hockey_robot) which is very similar with alira pong game. The gazebo and ros interfaces are implement referring [openai_ros](http://wiki.ros.org/openai_ros).</br>
For ROS and Gazebo installing, I will not explain here, you can refer to my hockey game project or their offical website.</br>
